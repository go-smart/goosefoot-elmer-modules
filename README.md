**Primary authors** : [NUMA Engineering Services Ltd](http://www.numa.ie) (NUMA), Dundalk, Ireland

**Project website** : http://www.gosmart-project.eu/

This project is co-funded by: European Commission under grant agreement no. 600641.

These modules should be compiled as any other Elmer modules, and provide some additional bits of functionality - some is specific to a cancer ablation context,
but some of these may be more generally useful.
