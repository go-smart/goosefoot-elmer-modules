This is especially useful for offline debugging of simulation\nsettings, which you may (or may not) want to update in the\n\nCDM\n later,\nbut, in general, provides a simple workflow for taking STL surfaces, producing a\nvolumetric mesh, running an Elmer simulation and returning a clean STL\nisosurface.

The factory\ncan output locations at various probe extensions without these needing to be\npre-calculated on the client-side, or in the CDM. For this to work correctly, at\nleast in the current version, there must only be one needle present in a\nsimulation at a time. If needed, a workaround may be to add additional heating\npoints for a secondary needle to the first, provided all extension lengths and\ntimes match.\n\n\nSeveral probe location factories are contained in the GSSF codebase. These may\nbe extended by subclassing \nGoSmartElmerProbeLocationFactory\n and adding to\nthe dictionary, \ngssf.elmer_probelocation.probe_location_factories\n.\n\n\nA number of thermocouples may be defined, which can be used to label each of the\nheating points. These are passed to the actual solver and,\nnormally, used to switch points on and off according to some thermocouple-based\nalgorithm. The remaining points are split between \nends\n and \nmiddles\n,\nwhich are generally used to distribute power between two different levels by\nthe simulation module.\n\n\nThe default factories are outlined below.\n\n\nManual Probe Location Factory\n\n\nGoSmartElmerProbeLocationFactoryManual\n is selected by setting the point\nsources \nsystem\n to \nmanual\n.
