# Extensions to the Elmer Project included in GSSF

As part of GSSF,
we have incorporated some minor alterations to the upstream solver, and
added a series of plug-in solver modules, to simplify GSSA integration or better
support the ablation context.

## Upstream submission

The modifications to the upstream version of Elmer are branched from the
[Github](https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem) source tree to simplify
contribution.
